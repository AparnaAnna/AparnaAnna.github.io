My original field of study, for both my bachelor's and master's degrees, were in the field of Science (Biotechnology / Biomedical Genetics). During my Master's I learned about genetic disorders and how daily life activities (ADL) are difficult for those with genetic abnormalities. There is a significant amount of research detailing the causes and characteristics of genetic abnormalities. This information is useful only when you use it to make their lives better. 

I did not want to do become a scientist. I wanted to enable and help those with genetic abnormalities to live their lives independently. It took me a while to decide on how to go about it. That was when I decided to start teaching. I completed a Bachelors in Education. After speaking to a few friends on why I chose teaching and with a little research, I found an organisation in Bangalore that trains teachers and parents, to understand and teach children with learning difficulties. I trained and became a special educator.

I enjoy being a special educator. It requires a lot of patience and dedication.

In a nutshell, I want to help out those who are most in need. Those who are often marginalised by society, and maligned through no fault of their own.

Update: I have since moved to Australia and starting life all over. I hope to still be able to do something that will have a positive impact on people and their lives. 

I hope to document my ideas, experiences on this blog.
