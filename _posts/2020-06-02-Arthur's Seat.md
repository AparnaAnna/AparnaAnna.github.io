Mornington Peninsula is around 90 Km from Melbourne’s CBD. It is one of the most popular holiday destinations among tourists and residents. There are wineries, national parks, beaches and much more to explore. 
Our visit to the Peninsula was an unplanned one. We wanted to do something ‘nice and fun’ on our anniversary, hence, we decided on a short visit. While searching for a place to visit which was not too long a drive, my husband suggested Mornington Peninsula. Looking at the map, I was tempted to go to the tip of the Peninsula and to enjoy a beautiful drive along the way. We chose two places to visit – Arthur’s Seat and Portsea, since wanted to spend some time in both places. 

## Arthur’s Seat State Park

Since this was a relaxed trip, we started from home around mid-day. After around one hour, we reached Arthur’s Seat. Enjoying the Seawinds Garden and walking along the Summit Circuit are some of the  few things you can do here.

[The Enchanted Garden](https://www.enchantedmaze.com.au/), which has an entry fee, is located close to Arthur’s Seat.

There are viewpoints to the see the Port Philip Bay from different points on the road leading to Arthur’s Seat. But if you want to get a clear view with a bit of history, the Summit Walk is a better option.

There is Arthur Seat Eagle, a cable car ride, that will take you to the top, giving you a bird’s eye view of the town and the bay.

## Point Nepean National Park

When you drive towards the tip of the Peninsula, you’ll reach Portsea, where the Point Nepean National Park is located. You can drive up as far as the Gunner’s House within the national park and then walk/cycle along the road or the trails. There are many beautiful trails along the coast with spectacular views of the Bass Straight and the Port Philip Bay. You will begin to see the view after walking about 1 Km from the car park. This park has a variety of coastal plants and trees.

Point Nepean had a defence facility protecting the entrance to Port Philip. There are structures that used house the artillery – Fort Pearce and Fort Nepean. 

Fort Pearce has gun placements, underground storage and bunkers which are still standing.

## Food

Mornington has many restaurants which you can try  from. But keep in mind,  most restaurants open only at 5 in the evening on weekdays after they close for their break. Since we did not pack a lot of food, we drove around all the way from Portsea through Sorrento to Rosebud before we found a restaurant that was open. Thank God for [Smokin’ Joe’s Pizza and Grill](https://goo.gl/maps/MjrL9cHayQs5VBBH7) - we were able to get some pizza and nuggets.

It is good to research a bit on where you want to eat and plan your day accordingly instead of facing our plight. 

## Things to Carry

If you are planning a day trip to Mornington Peninsula, I’ll recommend the following things to carry with you :

1. Sanitiser (because of hygiene during corona)
2. Enough water
3. Snacks like fruits that will help you stay hydrated
4. Food if you do not want to go in search of a restaurant or if you want to enjoy the view from Arthur’s Seat
5. First aid
6. Sun protection
7. Jackets – windproof becasue the coastal area can be windy.
8. Sunglasses – do not forget sunglasses coz the sun will be in your eyes.
