A great and easy alternative to breakfast. It hardly takes any time to prep and have. 

Smoothie Base:

* ¼ cups of oats
* 1 tsp chia seeds

Soak the oats and chia seeds in water the previous night or in the morning (for half an hour) so that they absorb water.

## Dry Fruits Smoothie:
* 4-5 dates
* 2 figs
* 5 raisins
* or any dry fruit you fancy

* Soak the dry fruits in water for 5 mins. 
* Add the smoothie base and the soaked dry fruits in the blender.
* Add 1/4th cups of milk
* Blend until smooth.

## Banana and Peanut Butter Smoothie
* 1 banana
* 1 tbsp peanut butter

Add the banana, peanut butter, smoothie base and milk to the blender. Blend until the mixture is smooth. 

## Avocado Smoothie
* ½ Avocado

Add the avocado and smoothie base into the blender. Add milk and blend until the mixture is smooth. 

P.S You can change the consistency by changing the quantity of milk or by adding water. 
If you wish, you can add 1 tsp of flax seeds to make the smoothie. Do not soak the flax seeds.
