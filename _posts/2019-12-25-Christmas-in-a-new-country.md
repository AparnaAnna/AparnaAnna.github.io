# Christmas in Melbourne

This is my first Christmas in Australia, in Melbourne. It's uncanny. I'm not used to the heat in Christmas. Yes, granted I come from one of the hottest places in the world: Kerala, India, but that's besides the point. It's winter there in December - by tropical standards. *:P*
