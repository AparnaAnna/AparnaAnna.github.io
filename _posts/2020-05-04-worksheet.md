Worksheets can be used as an effective learning tool, if created and used in the right way. It can be used to teach any topic. It is easy to make and does not consume a lot of time. There is a certain format that I followed while making worksheets for children with special needs.

## 1. Goal
A worksheet should be made with a clear goal in mind. Identify the goal and creating a worksheet will become easy. 

## 2. Learning Styles:
It is important to keep in mind the various learning styles of students. Worksheets cannot be used in a one-size-fits-all manner. If there are students who find it difficult to read, a worksheet with too many words can be demotivating. 

## 3. Clear Instructions:
The worksheet should have clear instructions mentioned on it, preferably at the top. The students should be able to read and understand the instructions. 

## 4. No Clutter
It is important to keep the worksheets clutter free. Too many designs and doodles can distract students. The focus of the student should be on the goal that the teacher has determined for the worksheet.

Here is an example of a worksheet I made for a child in Grade 3.
