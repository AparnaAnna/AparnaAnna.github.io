There are many things I consider when choosing a travel destination, and cuisine tops the list. That was one of the reasons for choosing Greece as our honeymoon destination.

Here are some places that I enjoyed dining at in Greece. 

## 1. Marinos Restaurant, Korinthos, Greece

This was by far my favourite restaurant in all of Greece. The food was delicious and the service was amazing.  We had hired a yellow cab to explore Korinth and our cab driver, Christos was kind enough to take us to this amazing restaurant. 
They have amazing food, drinks and clean restrooms
We all ordered lamb gyros with wine and orange juice.

## 2. Volcano Blue, Fira, Santorini

This place had amazing food. But what caught my attention was their trademark olive spread with the bread. It is an in-house recipe and one of the tastiest. I ordered the shellfish platter, my husband ordered the salmon which was the best. We also ordered saganaki and calamari fries. 
The restaurant is situated overlooking the ocean and has the most friendly people working there. 

## 3. Murmura, Heraklion

This place was recommended to us and we went there. It is a quaint place located by the sea and along the walkway to the pier. 
The food was amazing. We did manage to click some photos of the starters but was not able to stop eating to click more pictures. The staff was friendly. They served us complimentary drinks when they heard we were there on our honeymoon.

I hope this list is helpful.
