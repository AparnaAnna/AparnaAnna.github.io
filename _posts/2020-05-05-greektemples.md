Greece is famous for its ancient temples and ruins. You need a ticket to gain entry to the temples. You can buy an individual ticket if you wish to visit one temple a day and spend considerable time exploring it or you can buy a combination ticket which will give you access to seven sites and is valid for 5 days. Temples that are not located in Athens are not covered under the combination ticket.
