Pizza is one dish that has remained my all time favourite. This simple, yet intricate dish is my go-to comfort food. Nothing beats the joy of a lazy night, enjoying pizza with a glass of wine, while watching a movie (a dream, date night scene which is yet to materialise).

The lockdown, the subsequent shutdown of restaurants, and the restraint on travel meant I had to learn how to make pizza. It is something that I had always wanted to do, but dreaded at the same time because of my fear of making a bad batch of dough for the pizza base. As I tried my hand at making the base, I realised it was not that hard. You do not have to follow the recipe meticulously. The measurements of the ingredients, for the most part, can be adjusted which will become easy after baking one or two pizzas.
The recipe that I followed was [the easy pizza base recipe](https://www.jamieoliver.com/recipes/bread-recipes/basic-pizza/) by Jamie Oliver. 

## Pizza Base:

The most important part of any pizza is its base. It needs to be flavoured well. Kneading the dough is very important as it makes the dough elastic and gives it the structure. The time taken to knead the dough is anywhere between 10 - 15 minutes. You will know the dough is kneaded well when it stretches without breaking. 

### Ingredients:

* Plain Flour : 400g
* Yeast : 1 x 7g packet
* Sugar : 1/2 tsp or just enough jump start the yeast
* Water : 300ml of lukewarm water
* Olive oil : 4 tbsp
* Salt : to taste
* Herbs : Thyme, Rosemary and Oregano as per your choice
* Chilli flakes (because I like the base, spicy)
* Semolina : as required

### Method

1. Mix the yeast and sugar in lukewarm water and set it aside for 5 minutes.
2. Transfer all the dry ingredients (except semolina) into a bowl and mix them to incorporate all the ingredients.
3. Pour the yeast and water mixture into the bowl and start mixing. You can mix the dough with your hands or a fork.
4. Add olive oil to the dough and continue to knead. 
** If you feel there is too much water, balance it out by adding flour. You will realise that when you start kneading the dough. If there is too much water, the dough will stick to your hands even after kneading for 5 minutes.**
5. Once the dough is mixed well, place it on a clean, well floured kitchen counter. 
6. Use the base of your palm to push and stretch the dough. Fold the dough, rotate it and continue stretching. Do this till the dough stretches without breaking off. 
7. Once you are satisfied with the kneading, divide the dough into two to four equal portions depending on the number and size of the pizza you want to bake. 
8. Take a baking tray, spread semolina on the surface to prevent the dough from sticking to it. Place the dough on the baking tray.
** I divide the dough into two equal portions and place one on one tray. The dough will need enough space to rise. Using semolina is better that using flour because semolina will prevent the dough from sticking to the base.** 
9. Wet a clean cloth and place it over the dough to prevent it from drying out. 
10. Let the dough rise for atleast one hour. 

After the dough rises, you can knead the dough again to push the air out, and continue to make the pizza, or store the dough wrapped in cling wrap, in the freezer, for later use.

## Pepperoni Pizza:

Once you have made the dough, the rest is easy. You can use any topping of your choice. My favourite is the pepperoni pizza. 

### Toppings:
* Spicy Salami as many as you want
* Mozzarella cheese
* Pizza sauce (Passata - 1 cup, herbs to season, salt to taste, chilli flakes)
* One chopped red onion 
* Chopped capsicum
* Olives
* Jalapenos
* Sun-dried tomatoes

### Method:
Place the pizza dough on a baking paper and roll out the dough. I like a thin base, hence I roll it out till the base is very thin. Flatten the dough using the back of your hands and then slowly spread it out using your fingers. Start from the centre and spread it outward. Do not use a rolling pin.

Top the pizza with the pizza sauce. I cover the entire surface with the sauce.

Cut the mozzarella cheese into thin slices and place them on the base. Do not keep it too close to the edges or the cheese will leak once it starts to melt.

Add the sun-dried tomatoes, olives and capsicum.

Top it with the spicy salami, sliced red onions and jalapenos.

Bake the pizza at 200C for 15 minutes.

Remove the pizza from the oven, cut it into slices (or not), and enjoy.
